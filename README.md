My Hyprland dotfiles. For Arch... btw.

very basic, most code or configs have been stolen from other people or chatgpt. 
I are not a programmer at all, I only made this public as a warning of what not to do, lol.
the .zshrc was largely just a kali clone.


Requires:

fastfetch - 
wal - for color changing w/ wallpaper script
	applies to terminal & moki

currently no install file, just move everything to your home directory


In conclusion... Don't download this, you'll only be disapointed.
