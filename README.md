<b>My Hyprland dotfiles.</b>
For Arch... btw.
A constant work in progress

Very basic, most code or configs have been stolen from other people or chatgpt. 
I are not a programmer at all, I only made this public as a warning of what not to do, lol.
the .zshrc was largely just a kali clone.

Requires:

fastfetch
wal 	- for color changing w/ wallpaper script
mako 	- notifications
hyprpaper
waybar
...Hyprland

currently no install file, just move -
.config
.zshrc
- to your home directory (You should backup your stuff)

In conclusion... Don't download this, you'll only be disapointed.

Notable keybinds:

Win+W		= Set wallpaper and change some colors with wal<br>
Win+H		= Restart OR start hyprpaper<br>
Win+Alt+H	= Restart OR start waybar<br>
Win+C		= Terminal<br>
Win+Q		= Kill active window<br>
