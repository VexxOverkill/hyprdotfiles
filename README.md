<b>My Hyprland dotfiles.</b><br>
For Arch... btw.<br>
A constant work in progress<br>

Very basic, most code or configs have been stolen from other people or chatgpt. 
I are not a programmer at all, I only made this public as a warning of what not to do, lol.
the .zshrc was largely just a kali clone.

<p>Requires:<br>
<br>
fastfetch<br>
wal 	- for color changing w/ wallpaper script<br>
mako 	- notifications<br>
hyprpaper<br>
waybar<br>
...Hyprland</p>

<p>Currently no install file, just move -<br>
.config<br>
.zshrc<br>
- to your home directory (You should backup your stuff)</p>

In conclusion... Don't download this, you'll only be disapointed.

Notable keybinds:

Win+W		= Set wallpaper and change some colors with wal<br>
Win+H		= Restart OR start hyprpaper<br>
Win+Alt+H	= Restart OR start waybar<br>
Win+C		= Terminal<br>
Win+Q		= Kill active window<br>
